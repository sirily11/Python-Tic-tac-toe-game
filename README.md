# Tic tac toe

Introduction of the Tic tac toe game. This game is written in python 3.5, so you can run the game with python 3.5 or later version.

## Traditional instalation:
1. Dependency

    This game are require you have installed the python3 at your computer. I recommond you install python with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) which will install a python with all the recommond package. But you can also use the python from [Python website](https://www.python.org). You need to have install PIL for image processing and tkinter for GUI.


2.  How to run the code

    First if you only have one python and the version is python 3 on your computer, then you could use 
    ```Python
    python tic-tac-toe.py
    ```
    if you run on mac or linux, then you probably want to use 
    ```Python
    python3 tic-tac-toe.py
    ```
